Create an HTML file for a team
Ask the user for input on team members and create a card for each team member
Update the provided templates with the information 
Three different profiles are supported: Manager, Engineer, and Intern


This program uses the inquirer package to get the values from a command line interface

Based on the role provided for each entry, a new card is generated and the html is saved as a object in an array
Once the user has completed entering team members the final HTML file is created
